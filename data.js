They often foreground the immediate experience of the artist in the moment of making a work. Whether creating live or real-time improvisations with human or non-human collaborators, or crafting role-playing performances, art games, virtual simulations, or spatialized soundscapes, our coding and disruption of rules and conventions stimulate unanticipated outcomes and imagine new realms of experience.",

In AT/SP, we focus on how our bodies adjust to and influence ever-changing sonic and technological landscapes. Sound as a practice is perhaps unique in that it defines itself through a particular bodily sense, and immersive practices in art and technology often go beyond the visual to engage kinesthetic, olfactory, and tactile experiences. Improvisation and live performance foreground bodies in the present, collapsing immediacy and reflection into a decentralized yet focused flow. These embodied practices augment perception, extend awareness, and promote Five senses + extension through technology, non-human sense?, embodied performance, enhanced/extended awareness, proprioceptive, augmented perception, prosthetic, surrogate, reciprocal -- art + medical design?",

How do we grapple - conceptually and practically - with the unique forms of transience that our practices encounter and create? In AT/SP, we continually adapt to the risks and potentialities of fluidly changing media and cultural conditions. For us, technology does not develop in a linear fashion that discards continuously previous manifestations; rather, we constantly revisit earlier technologies and cycle them through the current moment in a continuous interchange with history aimed at the indeterminate future. In doing so, we become stewards of history indexly0ging and honoring creative possibilities and alternative traditions as they continuously emerge, recede, and resurface.",

While any work can have poetic dimensions, linguistic systems offer rich artistic potential in their inherently complex collision of definition, arbitrariness, hierarchy, and community. AT/SP has a long legacy in the history of language and text-based art that includes innovative forms of media poetry, electronic writing, poetic computation, bio-poetics, transmission arts, and text-sound composition.",

In AT/SP, we produce works that engage with light, air, sound, DNA, and living organisms through practices such as acoustic ecology, bio art, and purpose-built kinetic systems to explore the organic environment. Often these practices intentionally blur the boundaries between subjects and environments, requiring us to understand ourselves as inseparable participants in the world around us and to explore the implications of that interconnectedness.",

This can take a purpose-built form through circuit building, sound synthesis, instrument invention, or interface design; or it can take an interventionist approach through hardware hacking, circuit bending, noise, or intentional mis-uses of technological devices and systems.

Game mechanics, virtual and immersive environments, robotics, kinetics, and spatialized soundscapes take the attributes of the physical, social, perceptual, and environmental systems of our world and reconfigure them into newly imagined realities. Artworks in these realms amplify our (real or imagined) bodies, question our preconditioned codes of engagement, and revise the possibilities of how we might reimagine ourselves and make space for human and non-human others.",
